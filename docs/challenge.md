## **EgoExo4D teaser challenges**

At [EgoVis workshop](https://egovis.github.io/cvpr24/) during CVPR 2024 we will host two teaser Ego-Exo4D challenges (Ego-Pose Body and Ego-Pose Hands). These challenges will run along our existing Ego4D challenges and are also eligibile for prizes. 

Please find details below on the challenges:

* [Ego-Pose Body](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2245/overview): Given an egocentric video, estimate the 3D body pose of the camera-wearer. Specifically, predict the 3D position of the 17 annotated body joints for each frame.

* [Ego-Pose Hands](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2249/overview): Estimate the 3D locations of the defined hand joints for visible hand(s). Specifically, estimate the (x,y,z) coordinates of each joint in the egocentric coordinate frame.
