Ego-Exo4D is a large-scale multi-modal multi-view video dataset and benchmark
challenge. The dataset includes time-synchronized videos of participants
recorded with at least one egocentric and four exocentric cameras. Participants
(camera wearers) are recorded during physical (Soccer, Basketball, Dance, Rock
Climbing) and procedural tasks (Cooking, Bike Repair, Health). The dataset
includes: [seven benchmark](./benchmarks) tasks with associated annotations, rich video-aligned
natural language data in three different forms, calibrated cameras with 3D camera poses (extrinsic
parameters / trajectories), 3D point clouds of the recorded environment, and eye gaze.
